        You can exclude any class with: <excludeClass>org.l2junity.scripts.somepackage.SomeClass</excludeClass>
        You can include any class with: <includeClass>org.l2junity.scripts.somepackage.SomeClass</includeClass>

        You can include any package with:<includePackage>org.l2junity.scripts.somepackage</includePackage>

        The priority of rules goes as follows:
            1) An included class will always run.
            2) An excluded class will never run even if package is included.
            3) A class inside an included package will run if class is not excluded.
            3) A class inside an excluded package will run only if class or package is included.
